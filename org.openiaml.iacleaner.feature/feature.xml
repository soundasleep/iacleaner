      This project aims to provide a Java-based code syntax formatter
for a diverse range of web languages, including HTML, Javascript,
PHP, CSS and JSP.

It allows you to format complex, messy web application code into
a more structured format.

To achieve this, it uses specialised reader/writer implementations
and a custom parser. As a result, this formatter is fragile at
best, so use at your own risk! However, it does come with a set
of automated test cases, to ensure that it generally outputs
suitable code.
